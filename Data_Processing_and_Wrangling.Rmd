## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#Check working directory
getwd()

#Load necessary packages
library(dplyr)

#reading in dataframe
Coweeta2 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/1040_Hourly_CR10_1_2080.csv")

```

```{r}
#Check dimensions
dim(Coweeta2)

#Check column names
colnames(Coweeta2)

#Select columns:
Coweeta_wrangled <- Coweeta2 %>% select(site, Year, YearDay, stemp05, stemp20, atemp100, smois30, smois60)

```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
