## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>


This repository was developed for our final project in Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872). The GitHub repository was the created at the beginning of the project to serve as the workspace between collaborators. The repository contains folders for data (raw and processed), code and output. The team members have made sure to commit and push changes following a work session, and have communicated closely to avoid merge conflicts associated with working on the documents simultaneously.
