Course Project Information:

Analysis of Soil Moisture and Precipitation Trends in the Coweeta Basin LTER
  The Coweeta Basin Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) site is deemed one of the oldest continuous environmental studies in North America. It is managed by the USDA Forest Service in collaboration with the University of Georgia. This site is located in the southern portion of the Appalachian Mountains and is primarily composed of deciduous forest.

## Summary

<describe the purpose of this repository, the information it contains, and any relevant analysis goals. What, why, where, when, how?>


This repository was developed for our final project in Environmental Data Analytics (ENV 872). The GitHub repository wascreated at the beginning of the project to serve as the workspace between collaborators. The repository contains folders for data (raw and processed), code and output. Separate files were created for the various components of the analysis. The file names include: (1) Data Processing and Wrangling, (2) Data Exploration, and (3) Data Analysis. The team members have made sure to commit and push changes following a work session, and have communicated closely to avoid merge conflicts associated with working on the documents simultaneously.

The goal of this analysis was to use skills that we have learned throughout the semester to generate and answer a specific research question. This investigation was intended to analyze trends in soil moisture throughout the Coweeta Basin, and we used soil moisture data from four sites (at four different elevations) to explore our research questions. In addition to soil moisture, we decided to include precipitation into our analysis to explore the relationship between these two variables. 

Our main research question was the following: Has soil moisture in the upper 30 cm changed in Coweeta Basin from 2000 to 2014 in each of the four research sites?

Other questions that were explored include: 
    Which sites experienced the greatest change in soil moisture over time?
    What is the impact of elevation on soil moisture?
    Is there a relationship between soil moisture and precipitation that can be observed these four study sites?

Null Hypothesis A: There was no change in soil moisture in the upper 30 cm from 2000 to 2014.
Alternative Hypothesis B: There was a change in soil moisture in the upper 30 cm from 2000 to 2014.

Null Hypothesis A: There is no relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at the four study sites. 
Alternative Hypothesis B: There is a relationship between soil moisture and precipitation at the four study sites.

## Database Information

<describe the origin of all data in the repository, including data collected from outside sources and new data generated by the investigator(s). If data was accessed from an outside database, the date(s) of data access should also be included.>

Soil moisture data were collected from the EDI Data Portal for Coweeta LTER 
(https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp). Coweeta LTER (248) was selected as the LTER Site and "Continuously measured forest soil moisture at four sites in the Coweeta Basin"" was selected as the dataset of interest. Accessed 11/21/22.
The following selections were downloaded: 
 * 1040_2000_2014
 * 1040.kml 
 
Precipitation data were collected from the US Forest Service Southern Research Station (https://www.srs.fs.usda.gov/coweeta/tools-and-data/). Daily precipitation data from recording rain gages (RRG) at Coweeta Hydrologic Lab, North Carolina was selected under Coweeta Datasets on the USFS Research Data Archive (https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/Catalog/RDS-2017-0031). Accessed 11/30/22.

The investigators generated four new datasets combining the monthly average precipitation with monthly average 30 cm soil moisture at the 4 sites monitored at the Coweeta LTER. 

## Folder structure, file formats, and naming conventions 

<describe the folders contained in the repository, including what type of files they contain>

The repository contains 3 folders. The Data folder contains 3 folders: Raw (containing csv files of data downloaded from sources), Processed (wrangled datasets containing only pertinent information for analysis in csv format), and Metadata (containing a md file of relevant information about the investigators, data, and analysis.)
